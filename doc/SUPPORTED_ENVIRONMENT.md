# Supported environment

This file lists the supported versions of roundcube and databases by the plugin. Other versions than those listed may
work, but have not been tested.

## Roundcube

The latest patchlevel of roundcube is supported for all branches of roundcube still supported by the roundcube project.

These currently are:
  - Version 1.4
  - Version 1.5

I recommend using the latest stable roundcube version, which the plugin is most tested with.

RoundCube CalDAV may work with older versions of roundcube, but is not supported.
